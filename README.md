# Welcome to the GMX Project  

**GMX (Generals Modding eXtended)** is a community-driven extension of the open-source *Command & Conquer: Generals ‚Äì Zero Hour* codebase.  

GMX is built directly on top of [GeneralsGameCode](https://github.com/TheSuperHackers/GeneralsGameCode), maintained by *TheSuperHackers* and community contributors.  

This project will:  
- ‚úÖ **Inherit all bug fixes and enhancements** from the community project.  
- ‚úÖ **Extend modding support** beyond INI editing, providing APIs and frameworks for advanced mods.  
- ‚úÖ **Remain compatible** with *Generals: Zero Hour* while enabling brand-new gameplay systems.  

‚ö° GMX is not a fork that drifts away‚Äîit is an **expansion layer** that tracks upstream fixes and improvements.  

---

## Project Overview  

The community project focuses on **stability, modernization, and bug fixing**.  
GMX builds on that foundation by adding a **new layer for modding and content creation**.  

### Key Features  
- **Custom Gameplay Systems** ‚Üí damage types, weather effects, advanced AI, special effects.  
- **Improved Tooling** ‚Üí better error reporting, debugging tools, hot-reload for modders.  
- **Asset Expansion** ‚Üí support for new particle effects, shaders, audio, and UI integration.  
- **Upstream Sync** ‚Üí every release includes the latest GeneralsGameCode fixes.  

---

## Versioning  

GMX follows **semantic versioning** (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`):  

- **Patch releases** (`1.04.1`) ‚Üí Upstream fixes only, no breaking changes.  
- **Minor releases** (`1.3.0`) ‚Üí New modding features, backwards compatible.  
- **Major releases** (`2.0.0`) ‚Üí Breaking changes or when retail compatibility is dropped.  

Each GMX release notes the **upstream sync point** (e.g., ‚ÄúIncludes GeneralsGameCode v0.9.4‚Äù).  

---

## Reporting Bugs  

GMX only tracks **bugs related to modding features, APIs, and tools**.  

- üêû **Game Bugs / Engine Issues** ‚Üí Report to [GeneralsGameCode Issues](https://github.com/TheSuperHackers/GeneralsGameCode/issues).  
- üõ†Ô∏è **GMX-Specific Bugs** (extended APIs, modding tools, new systems) ‚Üí Report in [GMX Issues](https://github.com/ahmed007boss/GeneralsGameCode/issues).
