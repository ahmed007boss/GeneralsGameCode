# TransportUpdate

TransportUpdate provides transport functionality for objects that can transport other objects or units.

## Overview

The `TransportUpdate` class manages transport operations for objects that can transport other objects, units, or cargo. It handles transport coordination, cargo management, and transport system integration. This update is commonly used by transport vehicles, cargo units, and objects that provide transport services.

## Usage

Used by transport vehicles and units that need to transport other objects, manage cargo, and handle transport operations. This is an **update module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- Transport operations are limited by transport system capabilities and transport parameters
- Transport coordination depends on proper transport system integration
- Cargo management is controlled by transport parameters and logistics
- Transport effectiveness varies based on transport capabilities

**Conditions**:
- TransportUpdate manages transport operations and cargo management
- The update handles transport coordination, cargo management, and transport system integration
- Transport operations provide cargo transport and management capabilities
- Cargo management creates realistic transport operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own transport parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses transport system for transport operations
- Integrates with cargo system for cargo management
- Uses logistics system for transport coordination
