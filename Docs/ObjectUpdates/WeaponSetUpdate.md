# WeaponSetUpdate

WeaponSetUpdate provides weapon set functionality for objects that can manage weapon sets or provide weapon set capabilities.

## Overview

The `WeaponSetUpdate` class manages weapon set operations for objects that can manage weapon sets, provide weapon set capabilities, or handle weapon set systems. It handles weapon set activation, weapon set management, and weapon set system integration. This update is commonly used by objects that provide weapon set capabilities, weapon set systems, and units with weapon set management functionality.

## Usage

Used by objects that can manage weapon sets, provide weapon set capabilities, or handle weapon set systems. This is an **update module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- Weapon set operations are limited by weapon set parameters and weapon set system capabilities
- Weapon set activation depends on proper update system integration
- Weapon set management is controlled by weapon set parameters and system capabilities
- Weapon set effectiveness varies based on weapon set capabilities

**Conditions**:
- WeaponSetUpdate manages weapon set operations and weapon set system coordination
- The update handles weapon set activation, weapon set management, and weapon set system integration
- Weapon set operations provide weapon set capabilities and weapon set system capabilities
- Weapon set management creates realistic weapon set system operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own weapon set parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses update system for weapon set update activation
- Integrates with weapon set system for weapon set capabilities
- Uses weapon set coordination system for weapon set management
