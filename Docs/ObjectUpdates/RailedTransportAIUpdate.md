# RailedTransportAIUpdate

RailedTransportAIUpdate provides AI functionality for railed transport objects that need specialized AI behavior for rail-based transportation systems.

## Overview

The `RailedTransportAIUpdate` class manages AI operations for railed transport objects that need specialized AI behavior for rail-based transportation systems. It handles AI activation, AI management, and AI system integration for railed transport units. This update is commonly used by objects that operate on rail systems, transportation units with rail-based movement, and AI-controlled rail transport vehicles.

## Usage

Used by railed transport objects that need specialized AI behavior for rail-based transportation systems. This is an **update module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- AI operations are limited by AI parameters and railed transport system capabilities
- AI activation depends on proper update system integration
- AI management is controlled by AI parameters and system capabilities
- AI effectiveness varies based on railed transport capabilities

**Conditions**:
- RailedTransportAIUpdate manages AI operations and railed transport system coordination
- The update handles AI activation, AI management, and AI system integration
- AI operations provide railed transport capabilities and AI system capabilities
- AI management creates realistic railed transport system operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own AI parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses update system for AI update activation
- Integrates with railed transport system for transportation capabilities
- Uses AI coordination system for AI management
