# WeaponSlotUpdate

WeaponSlotUpdate provides weapon slot functionality for objects that can manage weapon slots or provide weapon slot capabilities.

## Overview

The `WeaponSlotUpdate` class manages weapon slot operations for objects that can manage weapon slots, provide weapon slot capabilities, or handle weapon slot systems. It handles weapon slot activation, weapon slot management, and weapon slot system integration. This update is commonly used by objects that provide weapon slot capabilities, weapon slot systems, and units with weapon slot management functionality.

## Usage

Used by objects that can manage weapon slots, provide weapon slot capabilities, or handle weapon slot systems. This is an **update module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- Weapon slot operations are limited by weapon slot parameters and weapon slot system capabilities
- Weapon slot activation depends on proper update system integration
- Weapon slot management is controlled by weapon slot parameters and system capabilities
- Weapon slot effectiveness varies based on weapon slot capabilities

**Conditions**:
- WeaponSlotUpdate manages weapon slot operations and weapon slot system coordination
- The update handles weapon slot activation, weapon slot management, and weapon slot system integration
- Weapon slot operations provide weapon slot capabilities and weapon slot system capabilities
- Weapon slot management creates realistic weapon slot system operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own weapon slot parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses update system for weapon slot update activation
- Integrates with weapon slot system for weapon slot capabilities
- Uses weapon slot coordination system for weapon slot management
