## Overview

The `UpgradeUpdate` class manages upgrade operations for objects that can manage upgrades, provide upgrade capabilities, or handle upgrade systems. It handles upgrade activation, upgrade management, and upgrade system integration. This update is commonly used by objects that provide upgrade capabilities, upgrade systems, and units with upgrade management functionality.

## Usage

Used by objects that can manage upgrades, provide upgrade capabilities, or handle upgrade systems. This is an **update module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- Upgrade operations are limited by upgrade parameters and upgrade system capabilities
- Upgrade activation depends on proper update system integration
- Upgrade management is controlled by upgrade parameters and system capabilities
- Upgrade effectiveness varies based on upgrade capabilities

**Conditions**:
- UpgradeUpdate manages upgrade operations and upgrade system coordination
- The update handles upgrade activation, upgrade management, and upgrade system integration
- Upgrade operations provide upgrade capabilities and upgrade system capabilities
- Upgrade management creates realistic upgrade system operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own upgrade parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses update system for upgrade update activation
- Integrates with upgrade system for upgrade capabilities
- Uses upgrade coordination system for upgrade management
