# SupplyWarehouseUpdate

SupplyWarehouseUpdate provides supply warehouse functionality for objects that can manage supply storage and distribution.

## Overview

The `SupplyWarehouseUpdate` class manages supply warehouse operations for objects that can manage supply storage, resource management, and logistics. It handles supply warehouse coordination, resource storage, and supply system integration. This update is commonly used by supply warehouse buildings, resource storage facilities, and objects that provide supply storage services.

## Usage

Used by supply warehouse buildings and structures that need to manage supply storage, resource management, and logistics. This is an **update module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- Supply warehouse operations are limited by supply system capabilities and warehouse parameters
- Supply coordination depends on proper supply system integration
- Resource storage is controlled by warehouse parameters and logistics
- Supply effectiveness varies based on supply warehouse capabilities

**Conditions**:
- SupplyWarehouseUpdate manages supply warehouse operations and resource storage
- The update handles supply coordination, resource storage, and logistics
- Supply warehouse operations provide resource storage and supply capabilities
- Resource storage creates realistic supply warehouse operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own supply parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses supply system for supply warehouse operations
- Integrates with resource system for resource storage
- Uses logistics system for supply coordination
