# WanderAIUpdate

WanderAIUpdate provides AI functionality for objects that need wandering behavior and autonomous movement patterns.

## Overview

The `WanderAIUpdate` class manages AI operations for objects that need wandering behavior, autonomous movement patterns, or exploration capabilities. It handles AI activation, AI management, and AI system integration for wandering units. This update is commonly used by objects that need autonomous movement, exploration units with wandering behavior, and AI-controlled units with patrol patterns.

## Usage

Used by objects that need wandering behavior, autonomous movement patterns, or exploration capabilities. This is an **update module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- AI operations are limited by AI parameters and wandering system capabilities
- AI activation depends on proper update system integration
- AI management is controlled by AI parameters and system capabilities
- AI effectiveness varies based on wandering capabilities

**Conditions**:
- WanderAIUpdate manages AI operations and wandering system coordination
- The update handles AI activation, AI management, and AI system integration
- AI operations provide wandering capabilities and AI system capabilities
- AI management creates realistic wandering system operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own AI parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses update system for AI update activation
- Integrates with wandering system for movement capabilities
- Uses AI coordination system for AI management
