# TunnelNetworkUpdate

TunnelNetworkUpdate provides tunnel network functionality for objects that can create or use tunnel networks.

## Overview

The `TunnelNetworkUpdate` class manages tunnel network operations for objects that can create tunnel networks, use tunnels for movement, or manage tunnel-based transportation. It handles tunnel network coordination, tunnel creation, and tunnel system integration. This update is commonly used by tunnel network objects, tunnel creation units, and objects that provide tunnel transportation services.

## Usage

Used by objects that can create tunnel networks, use tunnels for movement, or manage tunnel-based transportation. This is an **update module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- Tunnel network operations are limited by tunnel system capabilities and network parameters
- Tunnel creation depends on proper tunnel system integration
- Tunnel coordination is controlled by network parameters and system capabilities
- Tunnel effectiveness varies based on tunnel network capabilities

**Conditions**:
- TunnelNetworkUpdate manages tunnel network operations and tunnel creation
- The update handles tunnel coordination, tunnel creation, and tunnel system integration
- Tunnel network operations provide tunnel creation and transportation capabilities
- Tunnel coordination creates realistic tunnel network operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own tunnel parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses tunnel system for tunnel network operations
- Integrates with movement system for tunnel transportation
- Uses network system for tunnel coordination
