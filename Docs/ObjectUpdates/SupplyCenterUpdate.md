# SupplyCenterUpdate

SupplyCenterUpdate provides supply center functionality for objects that can manage supply operations.

## Overview

The `SupplyCenterUpdate` class manages supply center operations for objects that can manage supply operations, resource distribution, and logistics. It handles supply center coordination, resource management, and supply system integration. This update is commonly used by supply center buildings, resource management facilities, and objects that provide supply services.

## Usage

Used by supply center buildings and structures that need to manage supply operations, resource distribution, and logistics. This is an **update module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- Supply center operations are limited by supply system capabilities and center parameters
- Supply coordination depends on proper supply system integration
- Resource management is controlled by supply center parameters and logistics
- Supply effectiveness varies based on supply center capabilities

**Conditions**:
- SupplyCenterUpdate manages supply center operations and resource management
- The update handles supply coordination, resource distribution, and logistics
- Supply center operations provide resource management and supply capabilities
- Resource management creates realistic supply center operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own supply parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses supply system for supply center operations
- Integrates with resource system for resource management
- Uses logistics system for supply coordination
