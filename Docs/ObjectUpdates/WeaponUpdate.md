# WeaponUpdate

WeaponUpdate provides weapon functionality for objects that can manage weapons or provide weapon capabilities.

## Overview

The `WeaponUpdate` class manages weapon operations for objects that can manage weapons, provide weapon capabilities, or handle weapon systems. It handles weapon activation, weapon management, and weapon system integration. This update is commonly used by objects that provide weapon capabilities, weapon systems, and units with weapon management functionality.

## Usage

Used by objects that can manage weapons, provide weapon capabilities, or handle weapon systems. This is an **update module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- Weapon operations are limited by weapon parameters and weapon system capabilities
- Weapon activation depends on proper update system integration
- Weapon management is controlled by weapon parameters and system capabilities
- Weapon effectiveness varies based on weapon capabilities

**Conditions**:
- WeaponUpdate manages weapon operations and weapon system coordination
- The update handles weapon activation, weapon management, and weapon system integration
- Weapon operations provide weapon capabilities and weapon system capabilities
- Weapon management creates realistic weapon system operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own weapon parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses update system for weapon update activation
- Integrates with weapon system for weapon capabilities
- Uses weapon coordination system for weapon management
