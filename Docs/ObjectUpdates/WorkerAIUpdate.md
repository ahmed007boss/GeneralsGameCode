# WorkerAIUpdate

WorkerAIUpdate provides AI functionality for worker objects that need specialized AI behavior for construction, resource gathering, and work-related tasks.

## Overview

The `WorkerAIUpdate` class manages AI operations for worker objects that need specialized AI behavior for construction, resource gathering, repair operations, and other work-related tasks. It handles AI activation, AI management, and AI system integration for worker units. This update is commonly used by objects that perform construction tasks, resource gathering units with work behavior, and AI-controlled worker units.

## Usage

Used by worker objects that need specialized AI behavior for construction, resource gathering, and work-related tasks. This is an **update module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- AI operations are limited by AI parameters and worker system capabilities
- AI activation depends on proper update system integration
- AI management is controlled by AI parameters and system capabilities
- AI effectiveness varies based on worker capabilities

**Conditions**:
- WorkerAIUpdate manages AI operations and worker system coordination
- The update handles AI activation, AI management, and AI system integration
- AI operations provide worker capabilities and AI system capabilities
- AI management creates realistic worker system operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own AI parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses update system for AI update activation
- Integrates with worker system for work capabilities
- Uses AI coordination system for AI management
