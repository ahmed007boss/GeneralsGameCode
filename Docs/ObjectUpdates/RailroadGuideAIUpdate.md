# RailroadGuideAIUpdate

RailroadGuideAIUpdate provides AI update functionality for railroad guide systems.

## Overview

The `RailroadGuideAIUpdate` class manages AI-driven rail network navigation and guidance for railroad guide units. It handles rail network coordination, guide behavior, and rail system integration. This update is commonly used by railroad guide units, rail network coordinators, and objects that manage rail transportation systems.

## Usage

Used by railroad guide units to handle AI-driven rail network navigation and guidance. This is an **update module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- Rail guide operations are limited by rail network capabilities and guide parameters
- Rail navigation depends on proper rail network integration
- Guide behavior is controlled by AI system and rail coordination parameters
- Rail effectiveness varies based on rail network configuration

**Conditions**:
- RailroadGuideAIUpdate manages AI-driven rail network navigation and guidance
- The update handles rail network coordination and guide behavior
- Rail guide operations provide navigation and coordination for rail systems
- AI behavior creates autonomous rail guide operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own rail parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses AI system for autonomous rail guide behavior
- Integrates with rail system for network navigation
- Uses coordination system for rail network management
