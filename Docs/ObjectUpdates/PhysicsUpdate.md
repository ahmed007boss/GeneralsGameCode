# PhysicsUpdate

PhysicsUpdate provides physics functionality for objects that require physical simulation.

## Overview

The `PhysicsUpdate` class manages physics simulation for objects that need realistic physical behavior including gravity, collision detection, momentum, and other physics-based interactions. It handles object movement, forces, and physical constraints to create realistic object behavior in the game world. This update is commonly used by projectiles, debris, vehicles, and any objects that need physics-based movement and interaction.

## Usage

Used by objects that require physics simulation for realistic movement, collision, and interaction. This is an **update module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- Physics simulation is limited by engine capabilities and performance constraints
- Collision detection depends on object geometry and physics system accuracy
- Movement is constrained by physics laws and game engine limitations
- Performance impact varies based on object complexity and physics interactions

**Conditions**:
- PhysicsUpdate manages realistic physics simulation for objects
- The update handles gravity, momentum, and collision detection
- Physical forces affect object movement and behavior
- Collision responses create realistic object interactions
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own physics parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Requires physics engine integration for simulation
- Uses collision detection system for object interactions
- Integrates with rendering system for visual representation
