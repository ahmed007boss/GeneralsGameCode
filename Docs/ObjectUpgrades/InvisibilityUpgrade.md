# InvisibilityUpgrade

InvisibilityUpgrade provides invisibility functionality for objects that can become invisible or provide invisibility capabilities.

## Overview

The `InvisibilityUpgrade` class manages invisibility operations for objects that can become invisible, provide invisibility capabilities, or manage invisibility systems. It handles invisibility activation, invisibility management, and invisibility system integration. This upgrade is commonly used by objects that provide invisibility capabilities, stealth systems, and units with invisibility capabilities.

## Usage

Used by objects that can become invisible, provide invisibility capabilities, or manage invisibility systems. This is an **upgrade module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- Invisibility operations are limited by invisibility parameters and invisibility system capabilities
- Invisibility activation depends on proper upgrade system integration
- Invisibility management is controlled by invisibility parameters and system capabilities
- Invisibility effectiveness varies based on invisibility capabilities

**Conditions**:
- InvisibilityUpgrade manages invisibility operations and invisibility system coordination
- The upgrade handles invisibility activation, invisibility management, and invisibility system integration
- Invisibility operations provide invisibility capabilities and invisibility system capabilities
- Invisibility management creates realistic invisibility system operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own invisibility parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses upgrade system for invisibility upgrade activation
- Integrates with invisibility system for invisibility capabilities
- Uses invisibility coordination system for invisibility management
