# SpeedUpgrade

SpeedUpgrade provides speed enhancement functionality for objects that can enhance their speed capabilities or provide speed improvements.

## Overview

The `SpeedUpgrade` class manages speed enhancement operations for objects that can enhance their speed capabilities, provide speed improvements, or manage speed enhancement systems. It handles speed enhancement activation, speed enhancement management, and speed enhancement system integration. This upgrade is commonly used by objects that provide speed enhancements, speed improvement systems, and units with speed enhancement capabilities.

## Usage

Used by objects that can enhance their speed capabilities, provide speed improvements, or manage speed enhancement systems. This is an **upgrade module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- Speed enhancement operations are limited by speed enhancement parameters and speed enhancement system capabilities
- Speed enhancement activation depends on proper upgrade system integration
- Speed enhancement management is controlled by speed enhancement parameters and system capabilities
- Speed enhancement effectiveness varies based on speed enhancement capabilities

**Conditions**:
- SpeedUpgrade manages speed enhancement operations and speed enhancement system coordination
- The upgrade handles speed enhancement activation, speed enhancement management, and speed enhancement system integration
- Speed enhancement operations provide speed enhancement capabilities and speed enhancement system capabilities
- Speed enhancement management creates realistic speed enhancement system operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own speed enhancement parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses upgrade system for speed enhancement upgrade activation
- Integrates with speed enhancement system for speed enhancement capabilities
- Uses speed enhancement coordination system for speed enhancement management
