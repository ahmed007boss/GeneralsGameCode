# UpgradeModule

UpgradeModule provides the base functionality for all upgrade modules in the game engine.

## Overview

The `UpgradeModule` class serves as the base class for all upgrade modules in the game engine. It provides the fundamental upgrade functionality, upgrade management, and upgrade system integration. This module is the foundation for all upgrade-based behaviors and capabilities. This module is commonly used as a base for all upgrade modules, upgrade systems, and upgrade-based functionality.

## Usage

Used as the base class for all upgrade modules in the game engine. This is a **base upgrade module** that provides the foundation for all upgrade-based functionality. All specific upgrade modules inherit from this base class. Use specific upgrade modules that inherit from this base class instead of using this directly.

**Limitations**:
- UpgradeModule operations are limited by upgrade parameters and upgrade system capabilities
- Upgrade activation depends on proper upgrade system integration
- Upgrade management is controlled by upgrade parameters and system capabilities
- Upgrade effectiveness varies based on upgrade capabilities

**Conditions**:
- UpgradeModule manages upgrade operations and upgrade system coordination
- The module handles upgrade activation, upgrade management, and upgrade system integration
- Upgrade operations provide upgrade capabilities and upgrade system capabilities
- Upgrade management creates realistic upgrade system operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own upgrade parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses upgrade system for upgrade activation
- Integrates with upgrade system for upgrade capabilities
- Uses upgrade coordination system for upgrade management
