# GenericUpgrade

GenericUpgrade provides generic upgrade functionality for objects that can be upgraded in various ways.

## Overview

The `GenericUpgrade` class manages generic upgrade operations for objects that need generic upgrade capabilities without specific upgrade types. It handles generic upgrade activation, generic upgrade management, and generic upgrade system integration. This upgrade is commonly used by objects that need generic upgrade capabilities, upgrade systems, and units with generic upgrade capabilities.

## Usage

Used by objects that need generic upgrade capabilities without specific upgrade types. This is an **upgrade module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- Generic upgrade operations are limited by generic upgrade parameters and generic upgrade system capabilities
- Generic upgrade activation depends on proper upgrade system integration
- Generic upgrade management is controlled by generic upgrade parameters and system capabilities
- Generic upgrade effectiveness varies based on generic upgrade capabilities

**Conditions**:
- GenericUpgrade manages generic upgrade operations and generic upgrade system coordination
- The upgrade handles generic upgrade activation, generic upgrade management, and generic upgrade system integration
- Generic upgrade operations provide generic upgrade and generic upgrade system capabilities
- Generic upgrade management creates realistic generic upgrade system operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own generic upgrade parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses upgrade system for generic upgrade activation
- Integrates with generic upgrade system for generic upgrade management
- Uses generic upgrade coordination system for generic upgrade system integration
