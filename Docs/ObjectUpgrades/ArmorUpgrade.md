# ArmorUpgrade

ArmorUpgrade provides armor enhancement functionality for objects that can upgrade their armor or defense capabilities.

## Overview

The `ArmorUpgrade` class manages armor enhancement operations for objects that can upgrade their armor, enhance defense capabilities, or improve protection systems. It handles armor enhancement activation, armor improvement, and armor system integration. This upgrade is commonly used by objects that provide armor enhancement, defense systems, and units with armor upgrade capabilities.

## Usage

Used by objects that can upgrade their armor, enhance defense capabilities, or improve protection systems. This is an **upgrade module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- Armor enhancement operations are limited by armor parameters and armor system capabilities
- Armor activation depends on proper upgrade system integration
- Armor management is controlled by armor parameters and system capabilities
- Armor effectiveness varies based on armor capabilities

**Conditions**:
- ArmorUpgrade manages armor enhancement operations and armor system coordination
- The upgrade handles armor enhancement activation, armor improvement, and armor management
- Armor enhancement operations provide defense enhancement and armor system capabilities
- Armor management creates realistic armor system operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own armor parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses upgrade system for armor upgrade activation
- Integrates with armor system for defense enhancement
- Uses protection system for armor management
