# ShroudClearingUpgrade

ShroudClearingUpgrade provides shroud clearing functionality for objects that can clear shroud or provide shroud clearing capabilities.

## Overview

The `ShroudClearingUpgrade` class manages shroud clearing operations for objects that can clear shroud, provide shroud clearing capabilities, or manage shroud clearing systems. It handles shroud clearing activation, shroud clearing management, and shroud clearing system integration. This upgrade is commonly used by objects that provide shroud clearing capabilities, shroud clearing systems, and units with shroud clearing capabilities.

## Usage

Used by objects that can clear shroud, provide shroud clearing capabilities, or manage shroud clearing systems. This is an **upgrade module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- Shroud clearing operations are limited by shroud clearing parameters and shroud clearing system capabilities
- Shroud clearing activation depends on proper upgrade system integration
- Shroud clearing management is controlled by shroud clearing parameters and system capabilities
- Shroud clearing effectiveness varies based on shroud clearing capabilities

**Conditions**:
- ShroudClearingUpgrade manages shroud clearing operations and shroud clearing system coordination
- The upgrade handles shroud clearing activation, shroud clearing management, and shroud clearing system integration
- Shroud clearing operations provide shroud clearing capabilities and shroud clearing system capabilities
- Shroud clearing management creates realistic shroud clearing system operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own shroud clearing parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses upgrade system for shroud clearing upgrade activation
- Integrates with shroud clearing system for shroud clearing capabilities
- Uses shroud clearing coordination system for shroud clearing management
