# HealthUpgrade

HealthUpgrade provides health enhancement functionality for objects that can upgrade their health or maximum health.

## Overview

The `HealthUpgrade` class manages health enhancement operations for objects that can upgrade their health, enhance maximum health, or improve health-related capabilities. It handles health enhancement activation, health improvement, and health system integration. This upgrade is commonly used by objects that provide health enhancement, health systems, and units with health upgrade capabilities.

## Usage

Used by objects that can upgrade their health, enhance maximum health, or improve health-related capabilities. This is an **upgrade module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- Health enhancement operations are limited by health parameters and health system capabilities
- Health activation depends on proper upgrade system integration
- Health management is controlled by health parameters and system capabilities
- Health effectiveness varies based on health capabilities

**Conditions**:
- HealthUpgrade manages health enhancement operations and health system coordination
- The upgrade handles health enhancement activation, health improvement, and health management
- Health enhancement operations provide health enhancement and health system capabilities
- Health management creates realistic health system operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own health parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses upgrade system for health upgrade activation
- Integrates with health system for health enhancement
- Uses health coordination system for health management
