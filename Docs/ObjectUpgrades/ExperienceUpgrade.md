# ExperienceUpgrade

ExperienceUpgrade provides experience functionality for objects that can gain or provide experience.

## Overview

The `ExperienceUpgrade` class manages experience operations for objects that can gain experience, provide experience bonuses, or manage experience-related upgrades. It handles experience activation, experience management, and experience system integration. This upgrade is commonly used by objects that provide experience generation, experience systems, and units with experience capabilities.

## Usage

Used by objects that can gain experience, provide experience bonuses, or manage experience-related upgrades. This is an **upgrade module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- Experience operations are limited by experience parameters and experience system capabilities
- Experience activation depends on proper upgrade system integration
- Experience management is controlled by experience parameters and system capabilities
- Experience effectiveness varies based on experience capabilities

**Conditions**:
- ExperienceUpgrade manages experience operations and experience system coordination
- The upgrade handles experience activation, experience management, and experience system integration
- Experience operations provide experience generation and experience system capabilities
- Experience management creates realistic experience system operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own experience parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses upgrade system for experience upgrade activation
- Integrates with experience system for experience generation
- Uses experience coordination system for experience management
