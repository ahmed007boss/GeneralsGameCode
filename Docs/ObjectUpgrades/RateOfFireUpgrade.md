# RateOfFireUpgrade

RateOfFireUpgrade provides rate of fire enhancement functionality for objects that can enhance their rate of fire capabilities or provide rate of fire improvements.

## Overview

The `RateOfFireUpgrade` class manages rate of fire enhancement operations for objects that can enhance their rate of fire capabilities, provide rate of fire improvements, or manage rate of fire enhancement systems. It handles rate of fire enhancement activation, rate of fire enhancement management, and rate of fire enhancement system integration. This upgrade is commonly used by objects that provide rate of fire enhancements, rate of fire improvement systems, and units with rate of fire enhancement capabilities.

## Usage

Used by objects that can enhance their rate of fire capabilities, provide rate of fire improvements, or manage rate of fire enhancement systems. This is an **upgrade module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- Rate of fire enhancement operations are limited by rate of fire enhancement parameters and rate of fire enhancement system capabilities
- Rate of fire enhancement activation depends on proper upgrade system integration
- Rate of fire enhancement management is controlled by rate of fire enhancement parameters and system capabilities
- Rate of fire enhancement effectiveness varies based on rate of fire enhancement capabilities

**Conditions**:
- RateOfFireUpgrade manages rate of fire enhancement operations and rate of fire enhancement system coordination
- The upgrade handles rate of fire enhancement activation, rate of fire enhancement management, and rate of fire enhancement system integration
- Rate of fire enhancement operations provide rate of fire enhancement capabilities and rate of fire enhancement system capabilities
- Rate of fire enhancement management creates realistic rate of fire enhancement system operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own rate of fire enhancement parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses upgrade system for rate of fire enhancement upgrade activation
- Integrates with rate of fire enhancement system for rate of fire enhancement capabilities
- Uses rate of fire enhancement coordination system for rate of fire enhancement management
