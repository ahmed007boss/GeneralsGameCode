# RangeUpgrade

RangeUpgrade provides range enhancement functionality for objects that can enhance their range capabilities or provide range improvements.

## Overview

The `RangeUpgrade` class manages range enhancement operations for objects that can enhance their range capabilities, provide range improvements, or manage range enhancement systems. It handles range enhancement activation, range enhancement management, and range enhancement system integration. This upgrade is commonly used by objects that provide range enhancements, range improvement systems, and units with range enhancement capabilities.

## Usage

Used by objects that can enhance their range capabilities, provide range improvements, or manage range enhancement systems. This is an **upgrade module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- Range enhancement operations are limited by range enhancement parameters and range enhancement system capabilities
- Range enhancement activation depends on proper upgrade system integration
- Range enhancement management is controlled by range enhancement parameters and system capabilities
- Range enhancement effectiveness varies based on range enhancement capabilities

**Conditions**:
- RangeUpgrade manages range enhancement operations and range enhancement system coordination
- The upgrade handles range enhancement activation, range enhancement management, and range enhancement system integration
- Range enhancement operations provide range enhancement capabilities and range enhancement system capabilities
- Range enhancement management creates realistic range enhancement system operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own range enhancement parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses upgrade system for range enhancement upgrade activation
- Integrates with range enhancement system for range enhancement capabilities
- Uses range enhancement coordination system for range enhancement management
