# WeaponSetUpgrade

WeaponSetUpgrade provides the ability to change an object's weapon set when an upgrade is applied, allowing for different weapon configurations based on upgrade status.

## Overview

The `WeaponSetUpgrade` class manages weapon set changes for objects when specific upgrades are applied. This upgrade module allows objects to have different weapon configurations depending on their upgrade state, providing enhanced combat capabilities. The behavior works by setting weapon set flags that the weapon system uses to select the appropriate weapon set from the object's configuration.

## Usage

Used by objects that need to change their weapon configuration when upgrades are applied. This is an **upgrade module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- Only changes weapon set flags, not the actual weapon definitions
- The new weapon sets must exist in the object's weapon configuration
- Weapon set changes are applied immediately when the upgrade is activated
- Objects must have weapon systems to function properly

**Conditions**:
- WeaponSetUpgrade changes the object's weapon set when the specified upgrade is applied
- The upgrade integrates with the upgrade system for conditional activation
- Weapon set flags are used by the weapon system to select appropriate weapons
- The upgrade can both set new weapon set flags and clear existing ones
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own weapon set changes

**Dependencies**:
- Requires an object with upgrade system integration
- The new weapon sets must exist in the object's weapon configuration
- Objects must have weapon systems to function properly
- The weapon set system must be properly configured
