# RadarUpgrade

RadarUpgrade provides radar functionality for objects that can provide radar capabilities or manage radar systems.

## Overview

The `RadarUpgrade` class manages radar operations for objects that can provide radar capabilities, manage radar systems, or enhance radar functionality. It handles radar activation, radar management, and radar system integration. This upgrade is commonly used by objects that provide radar capabilities, radar systems, and units with radar enhancements.

## Usage

Used by objects that can provide radar capabilities, manage radar systems, or enhance radar functionality. This is an **upgrade module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- Radar operations are limited by radar parameters and radar system capabilities
- Radar activation depends on proper upgrade system integration
- Radar management is controlled by radar parameters and system capabilities
- Radar effectiveness varies based on radar capabilities

**Conditions**:
- RadarUpgrade manages radar operations and radar system coordination
- The upgrade handles radar activation, radar management, and radar system integration
- Radar operations provide radar capabilities and radar system capabilities
- Radar management creates realistic radar system operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own radar parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses upgrade system for radar upgrade activation
- Integrates with radar system for radar capabilities
- Uses radar coordination system for radar management
