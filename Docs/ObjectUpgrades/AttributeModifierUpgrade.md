# AttributeModifierUpgrade

AttributeModifierUpgrade provides attribute modification functionality for objects that can modify their attributes or stats.

## Overview

The `AttributeModifierUpgrade` class manages attribute modification operations for objects that can modify their attributes, enhance stats, or improve various characteristics. It handles attribute enhancement activation, attribute improvement, and attribute system integration. This upgrade is commonly used by objects that provide attribute enhancement, stat systems, and units with attribute modification capabilities.

## Usage

Used by objects that can modify their attributes, enhance stats, or improve various characteristics. This is an **upgrade module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- Attribute modification operations are limited by attribute parameters and attribute system capabilities
- Attribute activation depends on proper upgrade system integration
- Attribute management is controlled by attribute parameters and system capabilities
- Attribute effectiveness varies based on attribute capabilities

**Conditions**:
- AttributeModifierUpgrade manages attribute modification operations and attribute system coordination
- The upgrade handles attribute enhancement activation, attribute improvement, and attribute management
- Attribute modification operations provide attribute enhancement and attribute system capabilities
- Attribute management creates realistic attribute system operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own attribute parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses upgrade system for attribute upgrade activation
- Integrates with attribute system for attribute enhancement
- Uses stat system for attribute management
