# StealthUpgrade

StealthUpgrade provides stealth functionality for objects that can become stealthed or provide stealth capabilities.

## Overview

The `StealthUpgrade` class manages stealth operations for objects that can become stealthed, provide stealth capabilities, or manage stealth systems. It handles stealth activation, stealth management, and stealth system integration. This upgrade is commonly used by objects that provide stealth capabilities, stealth systems, and units with stealth capabilities.

## Usage

Used by objects that can become stealthed, provide stealth capabilities, or manage stealth systems. This is an **upgrade module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- Stealth operations are limited by stealth parameters and stealth system capabilities
- Stealth activation depends on proper upgrade system integration
- Stealth management is controlled by stealth parameters and system capabilities
- Stealth effectiveness varies based on stealth capabilities

**Conditions**:
- StealthUpgrade manages stealth operations and stealth system coordination
- The upgrade handles stealth activation, stealth management, and stealth system integration
- Stealth operations provide stealth capabilities and stealth system capabilities
- Stealth management creates realistic stealth system operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own stealth parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses upgrade system for stealth upgrade activation
- Integrates with stealth system for stealth capabilities
- Uses stealth coordination system for stealth management
