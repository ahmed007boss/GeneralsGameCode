# WeaponUpgrade

WeaponUpgrade provides weapon enhancement functionality for objects that can enhance their weapon capabilities or provide weapon improvements.

## Overview

The `WeaponUpgrade` class manages weapon enhancement operations for objects that can enhance their weapon capabilities, provide weapon improvements, or manage weapon enhancement systems. It handles weapon enhancement activation, weapon enhancement management, and weapon enhancement system integration. This upgrade is commonly used by objects that provide weapon enhancements, weapon improvement systems, and units with weapon enhancement capabilities.

## Usage

Used by objects that can enhance their weapon capabilities, provide weapon improvements, or manage weapon enhancement systems. This is an **upgrade module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- Weapon enhancement operations are limited by weapon enhancement parameters and weapon enhancement system capabilities
- Weapon enhancement activation depends on proper upgrade system integration
- Weapon enhancement management is controlled by weapon enhancement parameters and system capabilities
- Weapon enhancement effectiveness varies based on weapon enhancement capabilities

**Conditions**:
- WeaponUpgrade manages weapon enhancement operations and weapon enhancement system coordination
- The upgrade handles weapon enhancement activation, weapon enhancement management, and weapon enhancement system integration
- Weapon enhancement operations provide weapon enhancement capabilities and weapon enhancement system capabilities
- Weapon enhancement management creates realistic weapon enhancement system operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own weapon enhancement parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses upgrade system for weapon enhancement upgrade activation
- Integrates with weapon enhancement system for weapon enhancement capabilities
- Uses weapon enhancement coordination system for weapon enhancement management
