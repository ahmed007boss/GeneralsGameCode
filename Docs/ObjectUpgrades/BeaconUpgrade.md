# BeaconUpgrade

BeaconUpgrade provides beacon functionality for objects that can create or manage beacon effects.

## Overview

The `BeaconUpgrade` class manages beacon operations for objects that can create beacons, provide beacon coverage, or manage beacon-based systems. It handles beacon activation, beacon management, and beacon system integration. This upgrade is commonly used by objects that provide beacon coverage, beacon systems, and units with beacon capabilities.

## Usage

Used by objects that can create beacons, provide beacon coverage, or manage beacon-based systems. This is an **upgrade module** that must be embedded within object definitions. Use the [Template](#template) below by copying it into your object definition. Then, customize it as needed, making sure to review any limitations, conditions, or dependencies related to its usage.

**Limitations**:
- Beacon operations are limited by beacon parameters and beacon system capabilities
- Beacon activation depends on proper upgrade system integration
- Beacon management is controlled by beacon parameters and system capabilities
- Beacon effectiveness varies based on beacon capabilities

**Conditions**:
- BeaconUpgrade manages beacon operations and beacon system coordination
- The upgrade handles beacon activation, beacon management, and beacon system integration
- Beacon operations provide beacon coverage and beacon system capabilities
- Beacon management creates realistic beacon system operations
- **Multiple instances behavior**: Multiple instances can coexist; each operates independently with its own beacon parameters

**Dependencies**:
- Uses upgrade system for beacon upgrade activation
- Integrates with beacon system for beacon coverage
- Uses beacon coordination system for beacon management
